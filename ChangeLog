 * Removed EventHelper.js, use jQuery instead
 * Removed visibleIf.css, use javascript instead
    -> now it works without adding display: block, which killed layouts relying on e.g. display: cell
 * fix regex to not choke on input-elements with [] in them
 * support input type number
 * work properly with select-boxes
 * dont disable input-elements with no connection to visibleIf
